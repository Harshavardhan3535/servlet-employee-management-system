A simple Employee Management System developed using **Java Servlets**, **JSP**, **JDBC**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Maven**.

The application demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the MVC architecture and follows the fundamentals of Java Web Development.

# Database

Database Name

```
employee-management-system
```

Example Connection

```java
String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/employee-management-system";
String username = "postgres";
String password = "your_password";
```

Update the database credentials according to your local PostgreSQL installation before running the application.

# Challenges Faced

### PostgreSQL Driver Issue

Several developers encountered HTTP 500 errors because the PostgreSQL driver was not being loaded correctly by Tomcat.

**Solution**

The PostgreSQL JDBC driver was added to:

```
WEB-INF/lib
```

allowing Tomcat to load the driver successfully during deployment.

---

# Future Improvements

- Login Authentication
- Session Management
- Search Employees
- Pagination
- Input Validation
- Role-Based Access Control
- Spring Boot Migration
- REST API Version
- Docker Deployment

---

# Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand how Java web applications work using Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and PostgreSQL.

It strengthened my understanding of the MVC architecture, request handling, database connectivity, CRUD operations, and deploying Java web applications on Apache Tomcat.

This project also served as a foundation before transitioning to Spring Boot and REST API development.
